  Before all else, I love writing embedded code. From the day on which I wrote my first assembly program on an 8051 microcontroller and manipulating it to control the speed of a DC motor, I've been obsessed with dealing with little abstraction from computer's instruction set. Then I discover electronics and the power of digital and analog circuits to make things that really work and the robotics was a natural fit so I build my first robot from scratch. Robotics is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving.  

  My first volunteer experience was for Parsian small size soccer robot team, I was given the opportunity to develop embedded electronic systems for the soccer robots. My first part-time job involved designing electronics and developing embedded firmware for laboratory equipment. Then a full-time position is offered and I have been happily expanding my role as an embedded system team lead ever since to design and develop pick & place robots for manufacturing lines as well as embedded industrial electronic devices like industrial drivers, signal isolators and transmitters.  

  I'm a hands-on manager and actively involved in day-to-day tasks. It gives me access to more ideas from the customers as well as my team members. Even when I leave the office, I tend to continue developing at the house. I believe that physical exercise truely feeds the brain and tennis is my passion and I find a beautiful crossover between my work and my sport. Most recently I've been working with some well-known robotics companies as a freelancer and I'm always interested to accept challenges. Reach out to <saeed.poorjandaghi@gmail.com> to connect!

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
